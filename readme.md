# Hextor

Hextor is an IRC client for privacy concerned people.

If you don't know what IRC is; you should go and learn about IRC first and decide if that is even a communications medium you would want to use. See IRCHelp.org](http://irchelp.org) for information about other IRC software and IRC in general.

If you don't know what things like Tor are, you should go and learn about Tor first. See [Tor-Project.org](https://tor-project.org) for information about Tor.

# Why Hextor?

Hextor is being made because most IRC clients are confusing and unweildly for new and even experienced IRC users to setup trustworthy channels of online communication.

# Design Objectives

- Support anonymity software such as Tor and OTR
- Encourage better online security habits
- Platform portability wherever possible
- Cleanup and remove as many plugins as possible
- Simplify the user interface and follow OS-specific conventions

# What's new so far?

- Logging disabled by default and GUI elements removed
- Supports .onion hostnames via SOCKS. (Defaults to 9050, configurable in the network settings options.)
- Project forked from Hexchat, renamed.

# What's planned so far?

In the short-run, the following features are being developed:
- Refactor the UI menus.
- New OTR plugin implementation.
- SSL support enhancements (warnings, pinning, etc)
- Alternative CLI user interfaces.
- Attempt to support OSX better.
- Portable builds. "All In One" distribution of binaries, packaged in a single ZIP, with launcher scriptings for each supported platform. (Ie; a .bat file for Win, whatever makes sense.)
