# Hextor

Hextor is an IRC client for operational-security-conscious people.

If you don't know what IRC is, you should probably NOT use this software, it will most likely end up frustrating you more than anything else. See [IRCHelp.org](http://irchelp.org) for information about other IRC software and IRC in general.

If you don't know what Tor is, you really really shouldn't use this software until you understand why Tor is such a hot-topic these days. See [Tor-Project.org](https://tor-project.org) for information about Tor.
